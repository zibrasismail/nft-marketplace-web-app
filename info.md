use 0x1::option;, use 0x1::timestamp;:

Import the option for optional data and timestamp to store when the NFT was minted.

const MINT_FEE: u64 = 1000;:

Added a MINT_FEE constant. This will act as an optional minting fee for those not on the whitelist.

struct NFT Changes:

Added mint_time: u64 to track when an NFT was created to help with sorting in the future.

struct SaleEvent, struct SaleEvents and SaleEvents has key:

Added this to keep track of every sale. This allows for total sales, trending NFTs etc. to be calculated off-chain.

struct Whitelist:

Added a Whitelist resource to allow only certain addresses to mint without a minting fee.

initialize_whitelist and add_to_whitelist:

Functions to manage the whitelist of addresses that can mint without paying a fee.

is_whitelisted:

Function to check whether an address is in the whitelist.

mint_nft Changes:

Now allows anyone to mint, as long as they pay the MINT_FEE and are not on the whitelist.

When an NFT is minted, its mint_time is recorded

purchase_nft Changes:

Record the sale event to the sale_events resource.

Increment the total sales counter.

transfer_ownership:

Added ability to transfer NFT ownership without purchase.

Filtering Functions:

get_nfts_by_rarity can now also be paginated using limit and offset.

Analytics-Related Functions:

get_total_sales allows for retrieving total sales amount.

get_all_sales_events allows for retrieving sale events for analytics.

tip_nft_creator:

Simple function to send APT to an NFT creator.

How to Use This Updated Contract in Next.js:

Aptos SDK: Use the Aptos JavaScript SDK to interact with the blockchain and this contract from Next.js.

Connect Wallet: Let users connect with a wallet like Martian or Petra.

Contract Calls: Call functions on the smart contract using the SDK (e.g., mint_nft, purchase_nft).

Data Fetching: Use the SDK to call the view functions (e.g., get_all_nfts_for_sale, get_nfts_by_rarity, get_total_sales).

UI Logic: Implement the actual filtering and sorting logic on the frontend using data you retrieve from the smart contract.

Dashboard Building: Fetch the necessary data using the new functions provided in the contract and process them to create a dashboard using Next.js.

Frontend Tasks (Next.js):

Wallet Connection: Use a library like @aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-react to handle wallet connections.

Contract Interface: Create functions that call the smart contract.

Filtering Logic: Based on the filters the user applies on the frontend, call contract functions like get_nfts_by_rarity or get_all_nfts_for_sale and update your list of NFTs

Sorting Logic: Apply sorting to the array of NFTs retrieved from the smart contract on the frontend using array methods.

Important Notes:

Security: This is still a simplified example, proper security checks in a real app are important (e.g., input validation, access control).

Gas Fees: Every smart contract interaction costs gas. You will need to pay Aptos transaction fees.

Testing: Always thoroughly test your smart contract before deploying it on mainnet.
